# [parcel4me-php](../README.md) : Demo client

The client is the most basic implementation of the parcel4me web components.   
It was set up by doing the following : 

 1. Create a `/lib` directory
 2. Get the <a href="https://github.com/ParcelForMe/p4m-widgets/">p4m-widgets repo</a> and save in the `/lib` directory
 3. Run `bower install` in the `/lib/p4m-widgets` directory
 4. Move the *contents* of the `bower_install` directory back into the `/lib` directory


 TODO : add all the widgets that we use for into the demo client
